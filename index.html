    <h1>Abstract</h1>

    <p>Professor Hilary Robinson and her team are conducting an interdisciplinary study of the issues arising from the arrival of the algorithmic workplace in the United States. This area is particularly interesting due to “the emergence of digital platforms in the economy that is rapidly transforming economic activity”. The research will develop new evidence about the workers, organizations, and government institutions involved in the ”algorithmic workplace”. We aim to create visualizations for the research team to explain the data to the general public. The data was collected from UberPeople.net which is an online public forum for Uber drivers. By looking at the posts on UberPeople.net the research team hopes to gain insight into the issues that algorithmic workplace employees are facing.</p>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>

    <p>We chose to use a line graph to display the frequency of posts on specific keywords over time. The tilt can help explain the slope of how much of an increase or decrease this specific keyword is mentioned over time. This visualization represents days of the month (October) and the y axis represents the count which represents frequency. And on the x axis we have the days (time) and on the y axis we have the associated frequencies of each word represented by each line. The line graph makes it easier to observe the trend, i.e. to see whether or not the number of those posts increase or decrease. This visualization will be expanded towards all the date ranges in the JSON dataset. Currently showing only a subset from a partial subset of the main dataset. Lines will show once you select a keyword in the bubble graph.</p>


    <p> We created a bubble graph through D3. We used a size encoding based on the area of each circle corresponding to the frequency of how many times that word is used in the posts. </p>

    <p>
      We also created a network graph to show the relationships of topics and keywords of all the posts. We hope that this graph will help show how some issues may be connected and how some issues may be disconnected. In solving an issue for one problem, it is important to see the bigger picture and how that problem can affect other areas. There is a positional encoding for the lines that connect the data together. The thickness of the links show how often the links are found between two words.
    </p>

    <p>
      The brushing feature is available on the bubble graph, where the user can brush over the keyword to select them. By selecting the keywords, the user will link the selection to the nodes on the network graph. The brush links node on the network graph to show the connections of the selected keywords and highlights the node circle in red on the network graph.
    </p>

     <p>
      Further more, a line graph will show the trend of the selected keywords over time. Currently, the line graph is not available for testing due to a linking error that might distract the test users. Please test only on the linked bubble and network graph. The line graph is currently showing all 15 keywords, instead of the ones selected. (linking error)
