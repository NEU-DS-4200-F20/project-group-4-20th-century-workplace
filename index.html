    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    
    <p>Professor Hilary Robinson and her team are conducting an interdisciplinary study of the issues arising from the arrival of the algorithmic workplace in the United States. This area is particularly interesting due to “the emergence of digital platforms in the economy that is rapidly transforming economic activity”. The research will develop new evidence about the workers, organizations, and government institutions involved in the ”algorithmic workplace”. We aim to create visualizations for the research team to explain the data to the general public.</p>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
    
    <p>We chose to use a line graph to display the frequency of a word over time. The tilt can help explain the slope of how much of an increase or decrease this specific issue is over time. 
This visualization represents days of the month (October) and the y axis represents the count which represents frequency. And on the x axis we have the days (time) and on the y axis we have the associated frequencies of posts. The line graph makes it easier to observe the trend, i.e. to see whether or not the number of those posts increase or decrease. This visualization will be expanded towards all the date ranges in the JSON dataset. Currently showing only October 2018 from a partial subset of the main dataset.</p>
